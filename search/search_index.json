As Software-as-a-Service, goodmoves brings the power of actual artificial intelligence to next best actions (NBA). When communicating with a customer, be it through a webshop, an online marketing campaign or a phone call, one faces a difficult challenge: customers should purchase a product, accept an upsell offer, or renew their contract. No matter what situation a customer is in, there is one optimal course of action. Example case (traditional): A customer might consider cancelling a contract. No action is taken, so the customer terminates. At that point, a 10 % bonus is offered to win back the customer. In such situations, knowing the optimal next best action is invaluable. For example, based on past interactions, goodmoves infers that an incentive needs to be offered to a certain type of customer to prevent churn. But more than that, goodmoves can even suggest the necessary level of incentive and the channel through which it should be offered. This way, an automated email could be sent to the customer offering a not too small, yet not too large discount as a motivation to renew the contract. Communication flow with goodmoves API goodmoves uses reinforcement learning to learn about the customers\u2019 behaviour and suggest the next best action. This is achieved through a state-action-reward cycle. Here, the state represents the available information about a customer, for which the decision (an action) has to be made. It consists of customer data like an ID, demographic information, historic data (such as former purchases) and can be supplemented by additional features such as the time of day. In the example case from the previous chapter, a customer is in danger of cancelling a contract. When requesting an action for that customer to prevent churn, you send us the state. In addition, we need the list of allowed actions to choose from, depending on the current circumstances. For instance, you might want to exclude actions that would not be suitable for this customer due to company policies. Based on the state, goodmoves responds with a prioritised list of actions for a given customer. These recommendations let you know what the optimal next best action is. In our example, that means to offer a 5% discount on contract renewal. To allow the goodmoves AI to learn from interactions, it needs to be made aware whether the selected action was successful in practice. This is the reward. The machine learning algorithm immediately incorporates this feedback, continuously improving its recommendations.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#motivation","text":"This document addresses developers and tech deciders who want to integrate goodmoves into the tools and systems they use and maintain.

In this chapter, we provide short definitions and explain their usage within goodmoves. state The state is a dictionary that contains information that can be used to characterize an individual customer. It can include customer profile data like contract type, contract duration and payment histories as well as personal data like age or gender. actions Actions are strings that identify a set of alternative communication options to choose from for a specific customer. The goodmoves algorithm can then be used to rank the list of actions according to their predicted rate of success. reward The reward, a single number, is a measure for the actual success, e.g., the observed outcome after taking a specific action. It provides feedback to the AI and is used to improve the algorithm and monitor its performance. query_id Our service requires a unique identifier that must be consistently used over the course of each action and reward cycle: the query_id. It is an arbitrary string that allows us to relate the separate calls to our API for action request, action update, and reward submission. Sources of Data For a seamless integration, it is important to know where you can get the necessary data from. The larger a company, the more tools and systems may be at work. Consider which would support real-time interaction best, and which allow you to inform the recipient (employee or customer) about the next best action. Here are some suggestions: - Product feeds - Google Tag Manager - CRM software - campaign management - marketing automation - e-commerce-suite - data warehouse / data lake Ways to integrate What an end-to-end solution will look like highly depends on the software and processes present. Here are some basic approaches on how to integrate goodmoves within your current system: GDPR Notice We strive for responsible data handling. The use of our service does not require sensitive customer data like names or addresses. It falls within the responsibility of our clients to implement adequate schemes for anonymization. When provided with anonymized data, it is not possible to relate customer information to a real person with reasonable effort, or even at all, within the goodmoves SaaS.","title":"Integration "},{"location":"integration_/#integration","text":"","title":"Integration"},{"location":"integration_/#important-data","text":"A few concepts are key to the use of our service.
